# GLOSSARY

Bilingual (English ↔ Vietnamese) glossary for the managed marketplace project. Source of truth for naming consistency across SRS, HLD, LLD, DB Design, API Spec, code identifiers and conversations.

Rules:

- Vietnamese SDLC documents (`SDLC/*`) use the Vietnamese term.
- Code, API and database identifiers use the English term.
- When in doubt, the English term wins for technical artifacts.
